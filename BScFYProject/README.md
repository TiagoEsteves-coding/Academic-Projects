# BSc Project – Development of a Heart Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This BSc project focuses on the development of an AI–based desktop application for predicting heart disease risk using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The system is designed to support early risk assessment using structured medical data.

## Problem
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Existing systems often struggle with accuracy and usability, particularly when deployed at scale. This project investigates whether ANNs can improve prediction reliability while remaining accessible through a simple desktop interface.

## Approach
- Trained an ANN on a large cardiovascular dataset (≈68k records, 13 medical features)
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling
- Designed and evaluated multiple ANN architectures
- Integrated the trained model into a Python desktop application
- Implemented prediction and probability estimation features

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, pandas
- Tkinter (GUI)

## Results
- Best ANN architecture achieved **≈73% accuracy**
- Demonstrated reliable binary classification of heart disease presence
- Desktop application successfully provided predictions and risk probabilities

## Repository Notes
Model training and evaluation can be reproduced using the provided scripts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Neural network design and evaluation
- Data preprocessing for medical datasets
- Python desktop application development
- ML model integration into user-facing systems
