Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning.

In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric\nMSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states\nassociated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-\nand\/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane\ninstantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only\ninstantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to\ncontribute to the 4d superpotential.

A\nfew more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints\non the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting\nproperty that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of\nthe neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 08:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2007 12:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Ibanez","L.

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha.

Our\nanalysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar\nwind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,\n(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections.

Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16","authors_parsed":[["Bloom","Jesse D.",""],["Lu","Zhongyi",""],["Chen","David",""],["Raval","Alpan",""],["Venturelli","Ophelia S.",""],["Arnold","Frances H.",""]]}

We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines.

The catalog covers SDSS\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\nand r bands. The majority (2\/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\nquasars and find that is centered on zero.

The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN\nwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their\nspectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity\nFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with\nprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our\ndata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us\nto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By\ncombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted\nfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different\nevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the\ncombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is\na luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived\nfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the\nAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the\nexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we\nfind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that\nthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift\ngoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of\nX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmic\ndownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to\nmore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than\nthat of low luminosity ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 20:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28","authors_parsed":[["Bongiorno","A.",""],["Zamorani","G.",""],["Gavignaud","I.",""],["Marano","B.",""],["Paltani","S.",""],["Mathez","G.",""],["Picat","J.

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved.

By\nmapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the\ncorrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point\nparticles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that\nthe Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by\ncurrent and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of\nChern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 12:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Alexander","Stephon",""],["Yunes","Nicolas",""]]}

A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2007 10:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 15:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23","authors_parsed":[["Takami","Hajime",""],["Murase","Kohta",""],["Nagataki","Shigehiro",""],["Sato","Katsuhiko",""]]}

For J\/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic\nproperties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two\nkinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J\/J' < 1\/2 and a large\nmanifold of canted spin states for J\/J' > 1\/2. To include quantum effects\nself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the\noriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the\ndependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter\nkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical\ncalculations reveal that in the kappa-J\/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase\ndiagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a\ndecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We\ncorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various\nphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined\nby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin\nperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1\/2 model\nleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J\/J' >> 1, the\nground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,\nwhich is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2007 16:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 13:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2007 07:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Yavors'kii","T.",""],["Apel","W.",""],["Everts","H. -U.",""]]}

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger.

In a vector downlink channel\n(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to\ntransmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter\nhas very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel\nfeedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback\nrequirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number\nof antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method\nthat minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby\nminimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is\nshown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining\nbecause minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization\nof signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to\nquantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user\nselection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 20:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2007 17:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17","authors_parsed":[["Jindal","Nihar",""]]}

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar\nprominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of\nthe damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding\noscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is\nstill not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick\nradiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their\nrole on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The\ndispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived\nconsidering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an\nunbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel\nto the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the\ndispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is\nobtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect\nof conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode\nand depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the\ninternal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the\nfast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and\nthe external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external\ncorona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow\nmodes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.\nNon-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic\nmodes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 11:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2007 10:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Soler","R.",""],["Oliver","R.",""],["Ballester","J.

Previous models of\nSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse\nof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On\nthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into\ndust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be\ninjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

I find that for strong Hubbard interaction, the ground-state\nis dominated by magnetic correlations.\n  These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.\nInterchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels and\nit is not enhanced by frustration. For weak Hubbard couplings, interchain\nnon-local singlet pair tunneling is enhanced and magnetic correlations are\nstrongly reduced. This suggests a possible superconductive ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 17:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Moukouri","S.",""]]}

This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from\nconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear\nBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how\nprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function\ndeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation\nis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation\nbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for\ngalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and\na convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A\ncurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are\nformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would\ncorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger\ncentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some\nother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge\nrelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random\nmerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather\nthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized\nto other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear\nobjects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2007 18:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2007 17:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2007 16:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 18:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2007 04:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Peng","Chien Y.","","STScI"]]}

This area is marked\nby the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of\nintermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest\npeaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is\nexamined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that\nthe associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close\nexamination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of\ndiffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity\ncloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft\nX-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2007 20:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Ziambaras","Eleni",""],["Kleis","Jesper",""],["Schroder","Elsebeth",""],["Hyldgaard","Per",""]]}

Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available.

Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma\/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations.

Among\nmeasurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way\nquantum computer stands out as fundamental.\n  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum\ncomputer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs,\nwhich we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a\ndenotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning\nlocally and compositionally about these patterns.\n  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which\nallows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.\nStandardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture\nbased on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by\nexposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.\n  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:\nTeleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of\nthem into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory\nwe develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework\nwe have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is\nnot just particular to the one-way quantum computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 15:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-21","authors_parsed":[["Danos","Vincent",""],["Kashefi","Elham",""],["Panangaden","Prakash",""]]}
